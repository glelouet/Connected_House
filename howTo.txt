The projects need platformio to work
 docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html

platformio installs the required libs, compiles the used libs in a static way, links them to the present sources and allows to push the code of a project to device.

you need to go in a project folder and type
 platfomio run --target upload
to push the .hex to the device.
